2018 Robot Code for First Power Up

Important Branches: What they are for
dev: 2018 robot mechanical code
master: branch for final code
pid-code-connected: branch to combine distance and turnign PID Commands
pid-code-sat: branch with Turning PID Command
pid-testing-1: Branch with distance PID Command

Outdated Branches: What they were for
connection-testing: bare minimum code for testing connectivity errors
encoder: branch for figuring out encoders
pid-testing-2: branch of PID with older ideas of Distance PID and potentially power ramping
pid-testing-encoders: Branch of PID with encoder code added
pid-testing-timed: branch of PID with older ideas of linking Distance and Turn PID's
