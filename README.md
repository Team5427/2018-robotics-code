Important Branches & What They Are For:

for-competition: Our current working branch that we use for competitions.

pid-remove-kick: Our current testing branch for removing the kick from our autonomous with PIDs.

lone-star-central: The code used at the Lone Star Central regional.

master: The branch used to hold finalized code.


Outdated Branches & What They Were For:

dev: Old 2018 robot mechanical code

pid-code-connected: branch to combine distance and turnign PID Commands

pid-code-sat: branch with Turning PID Command

pid-testing-1: Branch with distance PID Command

connection-testing: bare minimum code for testing connectivity errors

encoder: branch for figuring out encoders

pid-testing-2: branch of PID with older ideas of Distance PID and potentially power ramping

pid-testing-encoders: Branch of PID with encoder code added

pid-testing-timed: branch of PID with older ideas of linking Distance and Turn PID's
